# We are dwarves

Found in 2014, we are a team of geeks, hustles and startup veterans. We live around the world but most of us based in Saigon, Vietnam. We are (forever) young and always eager to learn. We have passion and experience in making cool products, esp. cloud and mobile apps. We want to help entrepreneurs solve real problems using our approachs and solutions.

We call ourselves dwarves, the small and misshapen creatures in Norse Mythology. We are wisdom, natural good at smithing, mining, and crafting. We have Miners, Crafters, Wizards and Soliders.

We position ourselves as a [**Startups Factory**](http://venturebeat.com/2015/01/18/how-venture-builders-are-changing-the-startup-model/). We build innovative products, give a hand to build companies and also give seed investment. Join our network if you are **startup veterans**, can wear multiple hats at the time and want to build multiple world class products.

## Our core values

You should have the same DNA to join us

- **Customer first**: We provide the service with high quality and no latency response time. Customers have to be happy.
- **Geeky style**: We can do anything, wear multiple hats, take multiple approachs from official to tricky way to achieve the goal.
- **Teamwork**: **_Synchronisation_** and **_Collaboration_** are the most important key things. You can read this topic: [It's hard to become a team member](http://tieubao.me/writing/2014/12/05/it-is-hard-to-become-a-team-member/). We apply agile process to keep our spirits stick together.
- **Proactive**: Pick your most productivity time to work. You need to figure out yourself what you want to do and what you want to contribute aligned to the team goal as a dwarf in the tribe. We are too busy to tell you.
- **Growth and sharing**: You can learn another skill from other teammates. We are happy to share it with you. And we believe that working hard and improving yourself everyday will make you paid back later. Read [this topic](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-motivate-myself-to-work-hard) to keep yourself motivated.

## We do agile

Because we know that teamwork is one of important factor to be successful. We reserve a separate post for it. Checkout this post to [know more about our teamwork philosophy and how we apply Agile to improve the productivity.](/additional-info/agile.md)

## Hiring process

**_TL;DR_**: you need to be a culture fit and a values fit

The right skill set is only one factor in finding the perfect candidate. As the fast-paced start up team (We grow from 3 to 15), we care more about culture fit. Frankly, how your present can have a major impact on team morale and overall execution?

We dont recruit employee, we find a teammate. Every team member knows what they want to do, and who they want to be.

### Culture
As the early day, Dwarves Foundation started with few members. We understand how important the team culture is if we want to attract talents. Some cultures that we are proud of forming:

- Tech/non-tech talk: Each miner in our team is wearing many hats. We are not afraid of switching languages or stacks. To achieve that, a miner should have cross boundaries in every stack currently using. A backend soldier can easily read front end code, fix bugs without asking front end soldier to help. We host this talk every 2 weeks on Wednesday. Yes, certainly you can invite your friends to come! We also talk about non-tech topics, like finances or life purposes. We have [repository](https://github.com/dwarvesf/seminar) to store documents. 
[![Techtalk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwarvesf/WeAreHiring/master/images/techtalk.png)](/images/techtalk.jpg)

- Development process: Soldiers need proper process for their battle. Whenever a soldier joins a fight, he should easily using the process to catch up and efficiently get familiar with project. We defined [Gitlab process](https://github.com/dwarvesf/team/blob/master/gitlab.md) for helping new comers. Beside that, we have a tons of utility tools that boost productivities at highest as possible. We have [miner](), a tiny-but-not-weak solider helping team members easily managing their dotfiles, standardize the environment setting for languages and projects.

- Community contribution: We highly concern about Vietnam tech's community. Make this community stronger is one mission we want to achieve. We found [Golang Vietnam](https://www.facebook.com/golang.org.vn/) on 2014 and it now becomes one of the most affected tech group. We encourage our miners to dig more on open source projects and contribute as well. Some of them: [glod](https://github.com/dwarvesf/glod-cli), [working-on](https://github.com/dwarvesf/working-on). You can find us on some PRs of famous open source repositories, especially in Go language.

- Idividual innovation: Self-learning is a must. We let our miners have 20% of their working time for digging something for their own. We also have funds for buying books. Technical or non-tech books play the same important role.
